%\section{HW/SW Codesign}
%General theory regarding HW/SW Codesign. 

Most platforms have HW platform that executes SW application programs. 

HWSW Co-design => Meeting system-level objectives by exploiting synergism of HW and SW through their concurrent design. 

Typical problems of HWSW Co-design depends on application domain, implementation technology and design methodology. 

Digital design of HW is becoming increasingly similar to SW design.
